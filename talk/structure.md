# Toric fibres in local models of almost toric fibrations

In $ℂ²$ one can construct the Chekanov torus, which is exotic in the sense that
it cannot be mapped to a fibre torus by a symplectomorphism. By introducing a
nodal trade at a delzant corner, the Chekanov torus can be viewed as a fibre
torus of an almost toric fibration. In this talk we look at fibre tori in almost
toric fibrations to find additional examples of exotic tori. We show that in
some sense, these remain exotic if local models of almost toric manifolds are
embedded into tame symplectic manifolds. 

## Background ??
- chekanov torus/vianna tori etc?

## atfs
- integrable system + arnold-liouville -> action-angle coordinates.
- toric -> global action angle coordinates.
- almost toric = allow focus-focus sing. -> global action-angle coordinates "on
  universal cover of base"
- $B_dpq$ local model.
- Basics: mutation, nodal slide.

## versal deformations
- given we know displacement energy of CP²
- chekanov torus exotic ?
- vianna tori exotic

## B_dqp tori
- calculating displacement energy:
  - lower bound (J-hol curves)
  - upper bound (probes)

----------

## Intro

- Lagrangian tori in ℂ -> easy
- ℂ^n product tori, chekanov torus, twist tori, Auroux, Brendel

## ATFs

- hamiltonian torus action -> toric manifolds. critical points: elliptic-regular, elliptic-elliptic
- allowing aditonally focus-focus critical points -> ATFs
- auroux system/chekanov torus
- mutation, nodal slide
- vianna tori

## versal deformations

- nearby lagrangians
- chakanov exotic ?
- vianna tori exotic

## B_dpq

- construction (similar to auroux system)
- displacement energy upper (probes) & lower (J-curves) bound
